# Python Script for Measuring Power Consumption of PyTorch model on Jetson TX2 

This repository contains parts of [script to measure power consumption of Tensorflow model](https://github.com/lcm97/TX2-dnn-power-measurements) and [example script to train & test multi-layer CNN performance on MNIST dataset](https://github.com/pytorch/examples/blob/main/mnist/main.py).
It is intentional used for educational purpose only. 

## Requirements

A list of the required packages to run the power measurement is in requirements.txt.

```
cat requirements.txt
```

## Running power measurement on GPU and ARM CPU

```
# With GPU
